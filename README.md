In highschool, I had a persona known as the "Tiger Pimp", I would wear a green robe with white feathers and a green fedora with tiger ears. Our school mascot was a tiger and our colors were green and white. We had school spirit days where we dressed up, I created the tiger pimp outfit for our homecoming week's green and white day.
